1. Developed a deep learning pipeline for violence detection in videos using 3D CNN with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, classifying violent and non-violent content after preprocessing the RLVS and Hockey Fight datasets; optimized training with hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting.
2. Built a Location Reminder Android app using Flutter, Firebase, and Google Maps API, enabling geofenced alerts when users enter specific locations with real-time tracking and an intuitive UI.
3. Created an Automated News Aggregator using Python, Feedparser, and PostgreSQL, scraping live RSS/Atom feeds, parsing structured news data, and scheduling regular updates with minimal manual input.
