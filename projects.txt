Violence Detection in Videos using 3D CNN | Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
• Developed a deep learning pipeline using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to classify violent and non-violent
content in videos.
• Preprocessed the RLVS and Hockey Fight datasets by extracting and batching video frames, optimizing input
for training.
• Separated frame extraction from model training and fine-tuned hyperparameters (dropout, learning rate) to
enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Location Reminder – Android Application | Flutter, Firebase, Google Maps API
• Built a location-based reminder app that notifies users when they enter a predefined radius of a selected
location.
• Integrated Google Maps API for accurate geolocation and geofencing, enabling real-time position tracking and
reminder triggering.
• Designed an intuitive Flutter UI for setting location-reminder pairs and used Firebase for backend and
real-time data sync.
Automated News Aggregator using Web Scraping | Python, Feedparser, PostgreSQL
• Developed a web scraper to extract and aggregate live content from RSS and Atom feeds using Feedparser.
• Parsed headlines, summaries, and publication dates from multiple news sources and stored structured data in
PostgreSQL.
• Automated the scraping process using Task Scheduler to ensure up-to-date aggregation with minimal manual
intervention.
